## Instructions

This game is well known as "Memory Game" where a player has to match the same symbols on the two cards. If cards match, their color change to green and they stay open. If all cards are green - Player wins! Player gets starts after each completed game. Amount of stars depends on the number of moves:

**3 stars** - less than 20 moves.
**2 stars** - between 20 - 30 moves.
**1 star** - more than 30 moves.

When Player wins, the result is added to the leaderboard which it is right below the game. 

The result consists of: 
- starts
